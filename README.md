# Airline Data Analysis Project

## Business Problem

Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation services to clients for several years, prioritizing safety, comfort, and convenience for passengers. However, the aviation industry faces challenges like stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, rising fuel costs, and a tight labor market. These challenges are impacting profitability, and the company aims to address them by analyzing their database to identify opportunities for improving occupancy rates and average profit per seat.

## Key Obstacles

1. **Stricter Environmental Regulations:** Environmental laws are becoming more stringent, leading to increased operating costs and restricted expansion opportunities.

2. **Higher Flight Taxes:** Governments impose heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental concerns and generate revenue, raising the overall cost of flying and reducing demand.

3. **Tight Labor Market:** The aviation sector's labor scarcity raises labor costs and turnover rates due to the lack of skilled workers.

## Objective

This SQL-based data analysis project aims to identify strategies to increase the occupancy rate on underperforming flights, ultimately boosting the airline's profitability.

## Conclusion

By analyzing revenue data, making informed decisions, and optimizing pricing strategies and routes, airlines can maximize profitability while ensuring passenger happiness and safety. Balancing these aspects is crucial for long-term success in the competitive aviation industry. A data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization can lead to sustainable growth and success.
